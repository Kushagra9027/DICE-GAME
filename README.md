#Dice Game
\Description
This project is a simple Python-based dice game where four players each get one chance to roll a dice. The player who rolls the highest number wins the game. The game demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as functions, random number generation, and conditional statements.

\Game Rules
1.There are 4 players in the game.
2.Each player takes a turn to roll a dice, generating a random number between 1 and 6.
3.The player with the highest number rolled wins the game.
4.If there is a tie (two or more players with the same highest roll), the game announces a tie and no winner is declared.
